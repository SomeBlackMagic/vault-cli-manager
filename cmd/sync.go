Manage Vault secrets using a Terraform-style pull/plan/apply workflow.

Secrets are stored locally as JSON files, one file per Vault path.
String values that contain embedded JSON objects or arrays are expanded
into nested structures for human-readable editing, and re-packed on apply.

Subcommands:

    pull    Download all secrets from Vault to local JSON files.
            Prompts on conflict when a local file differs from remote.

    plan    Show what changes would be applied (local vs remote diff).
            Does not modify anything.

    apply   Apply local changes to Vault (after showing a plan and
            prompting for confirmation).

		Description: `
Download all secrets under VAULT-PATH to LOCAL-DIR as JSON files.

Each Vault secret path maps to a corresponding .json file under LOCAL-DIR.
For example, secret/app/db → LOCAL-DIR/secret/app/db.json

String values that contain valid JSON objects or arrays (starting with
{ or [) are automatically expanded into nested JSON for easier editing.

Conflict handling:
  - Local file missing:  write remote version
  - Local == remote:     skip (no change)
  - Local differs:       show diff, prompt for (l)ocal / (r)emote / (s)kip
  - Non-TTY (piped):     automatically keep remote

objects display granular field changes instead of the full blob.

  @G{+} Created:  writes new secret to Vault

Nested JSON objects in local files are re-serialized to compact JSON
strings before writing, so Vault always receives flat key-value pairs.
